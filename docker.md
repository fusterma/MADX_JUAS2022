# JUAS2022, MAD-X

During JUAS 2022, we will use Python as scripting language for the *MAD-X* course. We kindly ask you to make some "homework" before JUAS 2022 to prepare your laptop for the course.

For this course a **basic knowledge of Python is assumed**, in case you are not familiar with it an introduction to python video and a tutorial to fill the gap are provided in indico. 

During the course we will use Python3 in a Jupyter notebook and, mostly, the *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *pandas* and *cpymad* packages. 

## Jupyter-notebooks
JupyterLab is a user-friendly environment to work with Python. You can find an overview on [here](https://jupyter.org/).

## Working environment and Jupyter notebooks set-up
We provide the following approaches to set-up the working environment for the MAD-X course:
- Install and run a [![Docker](https://shields.api-test.nl:/docker/image-size/aoeftiger/docker-cpymad?logo=docker)] image we have prepared for you.
- Install python and packges using conda.
- Use [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)].

The first two approaches allow you to work locally in your computer while the third one not. We recommend you to work locally in your computer as it will be easier to save your work and keep the tool for private use later, but the third option to work directly on a browser is also available in case you have problems with the local set-up. 

In the following we will explain how to **install locally** the required software: we propose different approaches for OSX, Windows and UNIX systems, respectively.

For **OSX** users, please follow the instructions in the *OSX: Install and run a Docker image* section.

For the **Windows** users, please follow  the instructions in the *Windows: Docker Toolbox* section.

For **UNIX** users, please follow  the instructions in the instructions in the *UNIX: Anaconda + cpymad* section.

# OSX: install and run a Docker image
In order to  ease the installation procedure, we prepared a virtual environment that launch a Python3 Jupyter server (the installation on *cpymad* on OSX can be tricky, so we suggest to use the Docker image as suggested).

### STEP 1: install the Docker Desktop
Please install the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). 

### STEP 2: run the Docker image

Once the Docker Desktop is installed and running, open a terminal, move to a folder you want to use for MAD-X exercises and run the instruction
``` bash
>> docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v $HOME:/src/juas/  juastest/juas2022
```
This will download the image (~5GB): an internet connection is needed **only for the first time**, afterwords you can work offline. 
In addition, this command binds your home directory to inside the docker container such that you can save and load notebooks.
You should get something as
```bash
MACBE16107:Tutorials sterbini$ docker run -p 8888:8888 -v "$PWD":/juas sterbini/juas

```
:::info
**The last line is the most important one**.
:::

### STEP 3: open JupyterLab from a browser

Open a web browser and connect to the python server at (**in this case**, check the last line)
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=ea65f062bfce037fd7a3b47926393a0d5ded381785b0136b

You have to copy, paste and **edit** the last line on the address field of your browser.

You should see something as https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72798799/146044142-2c6c33bb-427c-4326-80a2-a2642bc0833e.png .


This Jupyter-notebook environment is setup with the software needed for the MAD-X tutorials.

Now you can create a new folder where to save your jupyter-notebook (right top buttom NEW) and also clic on *NEW-> Python 3 Notebook* on the right top icon and test the code example at the end of this document to verify that everything is working as expected.


# UNIX: Anaconda distribution

For UNIX system the simplest way to install Python environment  on your laptop is to setup manually your environment by installing [*anaconda*](http://docs.continuum.io/_downloads/9ee215ff15fde24bf01791d719084950/Anaconda-Starter-Guide.pdf) from  
http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/

### STEP 1: Anaconda installation
We suggest to install the Python 3.8 version (latest now, December 2020)
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
List the packages that are installed with
```
>> conda list
```
and verify that you have *matplotlib*, *numpy*, *scipy*, *pandas*, *sympy*.
If some of them are missing, please install them with, e.g.,
```
>> conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib 
```

### STEP 2: *cpymad* installation
The standard *anaconda* distribution comes with most of the needed packages but *cpymad*. You can install it following the instructions from https://github.com/hibtc/cpymad. In most of the case it is enough to open a terminal and do
```
>> pip install cpymad
```

### STEP 3: JupyterLab
Now you can launch from a terminal JupyterLab
```
>> jupyter-lab
```

:::info
If JupyterLab is not installed in your system you can install it with 
```
>> conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```
:::


The *jupyter-lab* command will open a browser.

The Laucher tab allows you to open a notebook or console or some basic terminal/editing environment.

You can clic on the Python 3 Notebook icon in the Launcher tab and test the code example at the end of this document to verify that everything is working as expected.

# Windows: Docker Toolbox

If you have Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise you can follow the instructions given for OSX. The other Windows versions are not compatible with **Docker Desktop**.
In alternative to **Docker Desktop**, there is a legacy software caller **Docker Toolbox** (we tested it on Windons 10 Home). This comes with an Oracle Virtual Box where you will run the Docker Image.

### STEP 1: Docker Toolbox installation
Download **Docker Toolbox** from https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v18.09.3/DockerToolbox-18.09.3.exe

Install it (using custom configuration).

### STEP 2: redirect the port 8888
You have to redirect the port 8888 of the virtual machine to the localhost port 50000 (you can use another free port if you like or if port the 50000 is already in use). This can be done from the [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (icon on your desktop) accessing the menu of the default Virtual machine:
'Settings'->-'Network'->-'Advanced'->-'Port Forwarding'.
Add ('+' icon on the top/right) a rule as shown in the following screenshot
![](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_a04d3eb6edaabf1a0a412c560f89519f.png)

This means that you can access the port 8888 of the virtual machine from the port 50000 of the localhost (127.0.0.1).

### STEP 3: install and launch the docker image
Now open the Docker Quickstart (icon on the Desktop). It will take some time to start the virtual machine. Then move to your home folder typing 

```bash
>> cd
```

Then type

```bash
>> docker run -p 8888:8888 -v "$PWD":/juas sterbini/juas
```
This download the docker image (only for the first time, ~5 GB) and run it.

You will get something like
![](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_8fe231a7c6b3663bfe9db5a8f78366ca.png)

:::info
**The last line is the most important one**.
:::

### STEP 4: open JupyterLab from a browser

Open a web browser and connect to the python server at (**in this case**, see the last line of the previous screenshot)
http://127.0.0.1:50000/?token=HereGoesYourAlphanumericToken

:::danger
You have to copy, paste and **edit** the last line on the address field of your browser. **Please remember to replace the port 8888 with the port 50000.**
:::


It will open a browser and you should get something as

The Laucher tab allows you to open a notebook or console or some basic terminal/editing environment.

You can clic on the Python 3 Notebook icon in the Launcher tab and test the code example at the end of this document to verify that everything is working as expected.

# An example of Python3 notebook in Jupyter Lab.

From the *Launcher* of JupyterLab select the Python 3 Notebook.
You can import the python library of MAD-X (*cpymad*) with the following command.
```python
from cpymad.madx import Madx
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
myMad = Madx()
```

and now you can twiss a simple FODO cell (more details during the course) with the following code
``` python
myString='''
! *********************************************************************
! Second part
! *********************************************************************

! *********************************************************************
! Definition of parameters
! *********************************************************************

l_cell=100;
quadrupoleLenght=5;
f=200;
myK:=1/f/quadrupoleLenght;// m^-2

! *********************************************************************
! Definition of magnet
! ********************************************************************* 
QF: quadrupole, L=quadrupoleLenght, K1:=myK;
QD: quadrupole, L=quadrupoleLenght, K1:=-myK;


! *********************************************************************
! Definition of sequence
! *********************************************************************
myCell:sequence, refer=entry, L=L_CELL;
quadrupole1: QF, at=0;
marker1: marker, at=25;
quadrupole2: QD, at=50;
endsequence;

! *********************************************************************
! Definition of beam
! *********************************************************************
beam, particle=proton, energy=2;

! *********************************************************************
! Use of the sequence
! *********************************************************************
use, sequence=myCell;

! *********************************************************************
! TWISS
! *********************************************************************
title, 'My first twiss';
twiss, file=myFirstTwiss.twiss;
'''
myMad.input(myString);
```

You can see the *Q1* and *betymax* parameters by executing this cell
``` python
myString='''
value, table(SUMM,Q1);
value, table(SUMM,betymax);
'''
myMad.input(myString);
```
and you can get a pandas dataframe with the information of the lattice by
``` python
myDF=myMad.table.twiss.dframe()
myDF[['name','s','betx','bety']].head()
```
You should get something like
![](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_6ffb4ff57ec6f11c385e9a405604b1c3.png)


To plot some data of the *twiss* table you can execute
``` python
plt.plot(myDF['s'],myDF['betx'],'ob-')
plt.plot(myDF['s'],myDF['bety'],'or-')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.xlabel('s [m]')
plt.ylabel('[m]')
plt.title('My first FODO cell')
```
![](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/uploads/upload_468cfab86d69ef405edce079a68b399f.png)


You can do also a bit of symbolic computation with 

``` python
import sympy as sy
import numpy as np
from sympy import init_session
init_session() 
la=np.linalg
L_cell=sy.Symbol('L_cell', positive=True);
f_1=sy.Symbol('f_1', positive=True);
f_2=sy.Symbol('f_2', positive=True);
f=sy.Symbol('f', positive=True);


QF=sy.Matrix([[1,0], [-1/f,1]])
DRIFT=sy.Matrix([[1,L_cell/2], [0,1]])
QD=sy.Matrix([[1,0], [1/f,1]])
# This is the OTM 
M=DRIFT@QD@DRIFT@QF
M=sy.simplify(M)
M
```

or FTT analysis using PyNAFF, e.g.,
``` python
import PyNAFF as pnf
import numpy as np

t = np.linspace(1, 3000, num=3000, endpoint=True)
Q = 0.12345
signal = np.sin(2.0*np.pi*Q*t)
pnf.naff(signal, 500, 1, 0 , False, window=1)
# outputs an array of arrays for each frequency. Each sub-array includes:
# [order of harmonic, frequency, Amplitude, Re{Amplitude}, Im{Amplitude]

# My frequency is simply 
pnf.naff(signal, 500, 1, 0 , False)[0][1]
```
